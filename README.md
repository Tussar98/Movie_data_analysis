Author: Tussar Sarkar  
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy  

## 📌 Project Overview

This personal data science project explores the key factors driving the commercial success of movies by analyzing a comprehensive dataset merged from IMDB and TMDB. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions in movie production and investment.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify what influences a movie’s box office revenue.
- Discover the most popular and profitable genres.
- Understand how audience engagement metrics impact success.
- Provide data-driven guidance for future film investments.

## 📁 Dataset

- Sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamchandra235/imdb-and-tmdb-movie-metadata-big-dataset-1m)
- Over 1 million rows with 42 features
- Covers multiple decades, genres, and production backgrounds

## 📊 Key Insights

- Budget vs Revenue: Bigger budgets tend to yield higher revenues, but with notable exceptions.
- Correlation Map: Budget has a strong positive correlation with revenue; other factors show complex, nuanced relationships.
